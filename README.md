# Planes Database Project

## React, NodeJs, MySql, ExpressJs

App with the purpose of managing a database of airplanes. The main page contains all planes with the options to add, delete or update each one.
The "add" and "update" option will take the user to a different page, where he can write his own preferences. The "company" field is the only exception, because the user can choose only from the companies that already exist in the database. Also, when updating a plane, the company is selected, by default, as the current company.
